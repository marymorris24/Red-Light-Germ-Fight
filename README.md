# Red-Light-Germ-Fight
Cornerstone of Engineering (Stacked) - Spring 2025, Final Project

## Project Overview
Red Light Germ Fight is a project combining Arduino and MATLAB to create a graphical game interface controlled by external electronic components, including a 3-button console and a joystick console. The project educates on Antibiotic Resistance to elementary-aged students through gamified representations of the causes and effects of Antibiotic Resistance.

### Note on Content and Contributions
This code is not the final version of the project code and is missing some game and storytelling elements that were included in the final project. The following code was developed entirely by the author with support and advice about code logic and game ideas from the professor, TA, and groupmates. Additionally, ChatGPT (OpenAI) was used for assistance with initial understanding and implementation of image display and image manipulation functions in MATLAB.
